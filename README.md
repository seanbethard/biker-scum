## What is Biker Scum?

_Biker Scum_ is the AI-powered voice assistant for motorcycle mechanics. _Biker Scum_ supports your motorcycle maintenance program with artificial intelligence to accelerate problem diagnosis and repair, improving mean time to repair, first-time fix rates and reducing mean time between failures.

## What is Biker Scum AI?

_Biker Scum_'s knowledge base (`RatBikeDB`) and inference potential. Use your own procedures, technical documents and diagrams to extend _Biker Scum_'s knowledge base for optimal prescriptive guidance. `RatBikeDB` supports on-device ASR, retrieval and neurosymbolic inference on classical computers.

## Why Biker Scum?

* Rising maintenance costs.
* Loss of talent and knowledge in workforce.
* Scarcity of tribal knowledge.
* Prescriptive repair guidance improves maintenance key performance indicators (KPIs).
* Improves first-time fix (FTF) rates.
* Improves mean time to repair (MTTR) rate.
* Reduces mean time between failures (MTBF).
